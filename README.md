This is a personal project of mine that aims to promote community awareness of wage gaps in today's job market. The organization in the website is completely fictional and information is taken from a variety of internet resources including a primary source of "The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap" by the American Assocation of University Women:

On the action.html page, a Google API is used to display a world map and allow users to navigate in the map. The API implementation is free of cost and the website does not operate behind a firewall (open access). The API allows this website to access and communicate with Google's mapping data, displaying the map on the website for users to see.
