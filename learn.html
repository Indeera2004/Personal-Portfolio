                  What is the gender wage gap?
               </h6>
               <p>
                  The gender wage gap has proved that women make less than men in specific areas. Mathematically speaking, the pay gap is the "difference in men's and women's median earnings" and can be represented 
                  through earning ratios and the pay gap itself. The earning ratio is calculated by dividing the Women's Median Earnings by Men's Median Earnings whereas 
                  the pay gap is calculated by taking the difference between the Men's and Women's median earnings and then dividing it by the men's Median earnings.

                  Statistics? 
               </h6>
               <p>
                  In 2017 alone, the earnings ratio was <b>80.499%</b> and the pay gap was  <b>20%</b> meaning that on average, women make 20% less than men. 
                  Furthermore, according to the U.S. Bureau, in 2017, the median weekly earning's pay gap was 18%. On a state level, The American Community Servey found that
                  the pay gap was the lowest in California where women were paid 89% of mens' earnings and highest in Louisiana where women were paid 69%. Regardless of the difference in the gap, in  both these states gender equality was and is still not reached and women are still NOT paid 100% of what they have earned. If this continues, women are not expected to reach pay equity until 
                  <b>2106</b>.

                  What Causes the Wage Gap? 
               </h6>
               <p>
                  The main reasons fostering the Wage Gap include the motherhood penalty, racial biases on women's careers, and the impact of occupational segregation. The motherhood penalty
                  is the concept that employers are less likely to hire mothers than women who do not have children. Even when mothers are hired, employers often offer lower salaries than they do 
                  to other women. However, men on the otherhand, do not suffer from this and instead benefit from it. They receive something called the "Fatherhood bonus" and earn more after having children. Occuptional Segregation refers 
                  to the women being forced into occupations with lower pay simply based on one's opinion of "women's work" and "female fields" such as teaching and education. Even women who work in male-dominated fields, such as Computer Science, still 
                  face a wage gap in their salaries.

                  Race, Ethnicity, and Age 
               </h6>
               <p>
                  These factors play a huge role in the pay gap between women and what a typical white man earns. Each woman has her own background and story, but her pay gap can depend directly on 
                  her race, ethicity, age, disability etc. For 2017, the Current Population Survey (CPS) found that Hispanic or Latina women made only 53% of 
                  what men made. Asian women had the smallest wage gap with being paid a high of 85% of what the common white man made. Age contributes just as significantly;
                  women between the ages of 20-24 were paid 90% of what men were paid but women aged from 55-64 were paid 74% as much as men.

                  Long-term Impacts
               </h6>
               <p>
                  The Gender Wage Gap hinders womens' abilities to prosper in their fields and is known for contributing to poverty as well with 13% of American women living in poverty compared to the 9% of men in poverty. 
                  The wage gap creates problems for women during their time in the workforce and even after they have left. Because of the wage discrimination, women are often  paid less 
                  income, social security income, and receive less life insurance benefits than men do. Not only does the wage gap affect women, but their entire family too. In a study conducted, 42% of women were the sole or primary earners for their family.
